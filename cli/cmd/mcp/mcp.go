// Package mcpcmd holds the `yuheng mcp` command tree.
//
// MCP (Model Context Protocol; https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) is
// the JSON-RPC 2.0 wire protocol agentic IDEs use to call external tools.
// `yuheng mcp serve` exposes a curated subset of the CLI as MCP tools so
// an IDE-side agent can list / view / search / chat against the user's
// active Yuheng profile without shelling out to the CLI per call. Most
// tools are read-only; chat and session_ask create conversation/message
// records.
//
// Package name is `mcpcmd` to avoid shadowing `cli/internal/mcp` (the
// transport-and-handlers implementation). Same naming hygiene as
// `agentcmd` / `sessioncmd`.
